            "1 tsp vanilla extract",

    "preparation": [
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.",
        "Melt the butter in a large heatproof bowl until it's just barely melted.",
        "Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar to the bowl, and mix to combine. Mix it just enough so that it's relatively smooth.",
        "Add the vanilla extract and egg, and mix again until just combined.",
        "Add the flour, baking soda, and salt to the wet ingredients. Mix the dry ingredients a bit and then stir everything together until the flour has almost disappeared, then add the chocolate chips, and continue stirring until the dry ingredients have been absorbed.",
        "Roll 1~3 tbsp of dough at a time into a ball and place on the prepared baking sheet.",
        "Bake for 11-13 minutes, until the cookies look slightly golden on the edges, and soft in the middle, but with no visible glistening rawness in the center.",
        "Remove the cookies from the oven, and allow them to cool for a few minutes, during which time they'll flatten a bit and cook a little more."
