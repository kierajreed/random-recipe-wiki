    "preparation": [
        "Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). Thouroughly grease the bottom and sides of a 9x13 glass baking pan. Set aside.",
        "<b>Make the crust:</b> Mix the melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the flour and stir to completely combine. The dough will be thick. Press firmly into prepared pan, making sure the layer of crust is nice and even. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove from the oven. Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the warm crust (not all the way through the crust) for the filling to attach more firmly.",
        "<b>Make the filling:</b> Sift the sugar and flour together in a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs, then the lemon juice until completely combined.",
        "Pour filling over warm crust. Bake the bars for 22-26 minutes or until the center is relatively set and no longer jiggles. Remove bars from the oven and let cool before serving."
